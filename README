OpenGraph for Java is a small class used to represent the Open Graph protocol (available from http://opengraphprotocol.org/

This project is entirely open source due to the size of the code, so please go nuts and do whatever you want with the code.

Due to the lack of useful native DOM parsers this class implements the HTMLCleaner library (available at http://htmlcleaner.sourceforge.net/index.php), please find the license for it at the bottom of this readme. There is the hope to remove reliance on third party libraries at a later stage.
--Usage--
OpenGraph testPage = new OpenGraph("http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/1217700-kick_ass");
String title = testPage.getMeta("title");

--Features--
Currently the class only provides a basic HashMap like representation of an Open Graph page, but the following features are planned.

#Output to HTML (render the meta data back out as <meta> tags)
#Create OG data from scratch (the ability to use this class as a reverse and generate OG meta tags)
#Geolocation support (given that the OpenGraph supports lat/long, better support should be provided)
